# Findings

1. **Poor inputs validation**: The input validation in the provided code is insufficient. For example, the validation function should check for more than just the presence of input fields.

2. **No checks for elements existence after `getElementById`**: There is no validation or error handling for cases where the form elements retrieved by `getElementById` do not exist in the DOM. This could lead to errors when accessing properties or values of non-existent elements.

3. **No optional chaining to prevent unexpected errors**: The code could benefit from using optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent errors when accessing properties or methods of potentially non-existent elements or objects.

4. **No `preventDefault` on event fire**: The form submission event listener should include `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form submission behavior and handle form submission programmatically.

5. **No error handling in `saveRecipe`**: The `saveRecipe` function does not include proper error handling. It should handle potential errors returned from the API request, such as network errors or server errors, to provide feedback to the user and ensure robustness of the application.
