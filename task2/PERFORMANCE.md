# Performance

## 1. Cache Recent Recipes
Caching `RecentRecipes` could lead to a reduction in network requests. By storing the results of this API call in a local cache, we can avoid making redundant requests for the same data, which will reduce load times and improve performance, especially if the data does not change frequently.

## 2. Implement Pagination for Search
In the `searchRecipes` method, it is highly recommended to add pagination to the query. This will allow the server to send back smaller chunks of data, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving response times. Pagination can significantly improve the performance of search functionality by handling large datasets more efficiently.

## 3. Implement Lazy Loading
As an alternative to pagination lazy loading. Initially we load only the data needed, and fetch additional data as the user interacts with the page (e.g., infinite scroll or "Load more" buttons).

## 4. Batch DOM Updates
To optimize rendering, we should add all new items to the HTML in one chunk. In the example provided, we simply adjusted the existing approach to build a single HTML string and insert it in one operation. However, for larger datasets, using a `DocumentFragment` can further optimize memory usage by allowing multiple elements to be created and appended to the DOM in a single operation without triggering multiple reflows and repaints.

## 5. Virtualized Lists for Large Data Sets
If we expect to render large amounts of data, implementing virtualized lists can greatly enhance performance. Virtualization involves rendering only the visible portion of the data based on the current scroll position. This can be achieved using a combination of scrolling event listeners, calculating the visible items dynamically, and updating the DOM to display only those items.
